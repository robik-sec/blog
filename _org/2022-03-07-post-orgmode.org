So here I start my journey to my first bug, lets see how this goes.
Of course as I'm an long time emacs enthusiast, I use org-mode in order to write my blog.

This might seems rediculus for some people, but most emacs users will understand me :)
Especially, as I can have this nice featues, like syntax highlighting, and maybe I'm already to old to learn yet another markup language.
