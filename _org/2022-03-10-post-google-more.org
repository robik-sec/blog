So I had a silent hour and decided to play a litte CTF, I already did some recon on this challange, and was already able to get to the machine.

Via an old apache RCE.

Generally everthing would have been quite straight forward. But I have two major takeaways today.

1. Do not give up easily.... most of the time I'm on the right path but doubt myselfe.
2. Inside a Docker-container, it might be worth to scan the network :)
