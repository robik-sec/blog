#+END_EXPORT

I currently spend quite some time on the eJPT learning path, not sure if this is the way to go, but it is free, and it definitly forces me to ensure I have the basics coverd.

Especially on the tooling site I was quite surprised from Nessus, I wasn't expecting such a high quality tool, but also to be honest I also wasn't expecting sauch a yearly price.
If you think on starting you own small pentesting company, 5000 EUR per year might be a challange to cover. Of couse the tool seems to be amazing, although I do not think that
with the defaul tooling anyone will be successful, at least in bug bounties..

THM the new room today, kicked my ass, I have an idea, but I need to spend som time coding.... which i'm not sure if this is not too much, Cannons on birds, might be the topic.
