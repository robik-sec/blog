Today I finally spend some Money on my carrer as a Pentester. I subscribed on THM. Yes after two month of nearly daly hacking this was time.
I'm still amazed of the quality of this Page. If I had this 10 years ago, I might never started my actual career as a digital designer.
Nevertheless, what have I learned today:

Gobuster is able to fuzz extentions, PHP has a syntax highlighting extension, and ffuf is a amazing tool.
And too much beer doesn't help, when trying CTF challenges.

I'm truly happy to have rediscoverd this nealy forgotten passon of mine.
I might will never be the amazing "hacker" I would like to be, but nevertheless I'm really having fun.
Like in the good old days with try2hack.nl, black ICQ and other tools :-)
