As I now subscribed to THM, I can finally finish the basics Rooms. On the one Hand this is the same as I do on INE, but on the otherhand, this is the stuff
I really need to understand, and to be honest, I learned something new today... so definitly worth to revisit again.

Especially as it is made really fun, the challenges and the Labs, are mostly simple, but they really show the basic principals.
Sometimes I feel they are too simple, but on the otherhand, there are also a lot of members with no prior knowledge.

So to sum, what was coverd today, mostly to finally remeber the Acronymes.

 - Authentication Bypass ::
 - IDOR :: Insecure Direct Object Reference
 - SSRF :: Server-Side Request Forgery
 - File Inclusion ::

I enjoyed all of them, but I would like to have some more exersises on IDORs
