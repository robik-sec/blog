Again repeating the same topics from other sources, I dug through the XSS sources on INE.
Honestly doing this basics in two different sources, with a short time delay really strenghes the basics...
at least thats what I'm thinking.

After that I spend some Time reading, and trying the dirtypipe exploit.
THM has a special room for that, and honestly its quite impressive how these eploits work... and Yes do not forget to patch your kernels :)
