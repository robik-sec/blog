Hi, today I learned about Nabbing,

although I had quite a hard time to get it going (Firefox prevents it per default) Something I didn't know yet.

There are numerous references, but this one is quite nice:
https://santexgroup.com/blog/what-is-reverse-tabnabbing-and-why-is-it-important-to-be-aware-of/

No Idea, why I still cannot find a solution, for the CTF, but appatently I need to try harder.
