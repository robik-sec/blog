INE now has shown me that also the "default" tools like Nmap and metasploit support bruteforcing, so it's not only hyrda which does the job...
although this is still the fastest and universal solution for bruteforcing.

Also did a burp room, in order to understand the tool a little better, but still not that happy with the GUI. Although makros etc. help to automate a lot.
