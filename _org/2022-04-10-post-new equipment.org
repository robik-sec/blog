Honestly, it feels like ages, and I'm still tired. Got new HW this week, hence needed some time to setup everthing and transfere
all the stufff to the new PC. Actually I'm quite surpriesed, how easy it went. Better than expected. And the new mini is amazing
although I'm still not a fan of the OS. But thank god there are VMs for this.

Spent some time on THM, finished up a room, I stopped on, as I went the wrong direction.
Again, as always, take more time, keep on trying, and never forget to scan everthing :)

The smallest footholds can help. Furthermore do not trust the basic exploit, ensure it is really not working.
