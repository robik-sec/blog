Yes, gameification works, at least for me. What have I learned today.... there are timers on linux, not only cron jobs.
System timers can start services like cron jobs... but they are much harder to find. but again ~pspy~ finds all the
thing running on the host...

How to get info about system-timers

~systemctl list-timers -all~

After that you can find the jobs in ~/etc/systemd/system~ if the services are readable, you at least see who starts them, and what is executed.
