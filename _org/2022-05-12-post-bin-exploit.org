Yes what can I say, since the nahamcon CFT I spend some time getting familiar with Binary Exploitation. And yes it is a ton of fun.
At least for me. Although the learning curve is really steep. Especially as there are a lot of tools to understand and master before you can really be effective in this category.

And I say this fully aware that I'm a complete noob. But some things to understand, maybe in this order makes sense:

 - Buffer Overflow
 - Return to Win
 - Modify Variables
 - Return to Shell

This are the things I at least understand the concepts and know how to exploit them, but honestly there are so many things you need to know to really use it

  - Cyclic patterns
  - debugger
    - Radare2
    - GBD, geff
  - pwntools

So much to learn that is really hard. But honestly I need to say, pwntools is maybe the best thing, which help with a lot of different PWN issues, e.g. Endianess conversion, payload forging, shellcode generation and programm interaction.
That's all really amazing and without it, it would be really tough, to solve the issues. Otherwise, it would be much more painfull.
