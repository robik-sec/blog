Still going on, but just want to write down my first learnings, and impressions. Generally it is again a lot of fun.
Fascinating is that it seems that I have no chance on the Web challanges, no Idea how to com forward... either I'm thinking to complex, or they are much harder than the other challanges.

Reversing an pwning, makes quite some fun. I guess I have a new hobby :)
