Today I used some new tools, and got a better understanding for some tools I already use:
Furthermore I learned how to access an vhost, if it is not resolved via DNS, which is simple but new to me&#x2026;
Adding the "Host: xxx.domain.com" into the header does the trick. All that with just two exersices on Pentesterlab, there is still much to learn

Honestly I still very surprised, how amazing these recon tools are, they are much better than I ever expected.
Simple, fast and powerful

Just the first start has already shown that this is quite fast, but there are more features to discover.

Already often used and loved, today I discoverd that I can also use the same tool for brutefocing dns and vhosts, not only directories.
