Today I finally found the Time and was able to watch the famous Bug Hunters Methodology V4.0 Talk from Jason Haddix.

<p>
This talk is simply amazing, it gives some insight, on how little I know so far about recon, but nevertheless
I published my Notes on a seperate Page on this Blog, I will try to keep them up to date and will add infos as I learn.
