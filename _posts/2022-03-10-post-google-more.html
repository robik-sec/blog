So I had a silent hour and decided to play a litte CTF, I already did some recon on this challange, and was already able to get to the machine.

Via an old apache RCE.

Generally everthing would have been quite straight forward. But I have two major takeaways today.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Do not give up easily&#x2026;. most of the time I'm on the right path but doubt myselfe.</li>
<li>Inside a Docker-container, it might be worth to scan the network :)</li>
</ol>
