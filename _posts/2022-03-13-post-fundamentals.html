As I now subscribed to THM, I can finally finish the basics Rooms. On the one Hand this is the same as I do on INE, but on the otherhand, this is the stuff
I really need to understand, and to be honest, I learned something new today&#x2026; so definitly worth to revisit again.

Especially as it is made really fun, the challenges and the Labs, are mostly simple, but they really show the basic principals.
Sometimes I feel they are too simple, but on the otherhand, there are also a lot of members with no prior knowledge.

So to sum, what was coverd today, mostly to finally remeber the Acronymes.

The main reason why I subscribed was that everthing was painfull slow with the free account, but today I still had the same problem.
What I figured out is that the open-VPn profile routes only the 10.* ip-addresses via the VPN. But if you import the profile into the
Network-manager this setting seems to be lost, and it try's to reroute all other accesses as well, therefore everthing was so slow.
Could have saved some money :)
