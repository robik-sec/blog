As I now subscribed to THM, I can finally finish the basics Rooms. On the one Hand this is the same as I do on INE, but on the otherhand, this is the stuff
I really need to understand, and to be honest, I learned something new today&#x2026; so definitly worth to revisit again.

So to sum, what was coverd today, mostly to finally remeber the Acronymes.
