Hi, today I learned about Nabbing,
</p>

<p>
although I had quite a hard time to get it going (Firefox prevents it per default) Something I didn't know yet.
</p>

<p>
There are numerous references, but this one is quite nice:

</p>

<p>
No Idea, why I still cannot find a solution, for the CTF, but appatently I need to try harder.
