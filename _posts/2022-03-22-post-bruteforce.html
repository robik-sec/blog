<p>
INE now has shown me that also the "default" tools like Nmap and metasploit support bruteforcing, so it's not only hyrda which does the job&#x2026;
although this is still the fastest and universal solution for bruteforcing.

Also did a burp room, in order to understand the tool a little better, but still not that happy with the GUI. Although makros etc. help to automate a lot.
