Yes, gameification works, at least for me. What have I learned today&#x2026;. there are timers on linux, not only cron jobs.
System timers can start services like cron jobs&#x2026; but they are much harder to find. but again <code>pspy</code> finds all the
thing running on the host&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
How to get info about system-timers
</p>

<p>
<code>systemctl list-timers -all</code>
</p>

<p>
After that you can find the jobs in <code>/etc/systemd/system</code> if the services are readable, you at least see who starts them, and what is executed.
