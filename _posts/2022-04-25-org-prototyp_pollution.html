So I spent some hours on the Intigrity challange, and while I was able to bypass the sanatization, and learnd quite some tricks, I was miles away from solving it.
And honestly reading the writups, I did not even know this is possible. Ao I still have quite a lot to learn on the JS side.
</p>

<p>
Following this write-up and the video, I'm finally able to understand what should be done.

</p>

I think the most valueable lession is that I know now that prototype Polution exists :).

This description gives some more insight on this.
but basically this small example shows everthing we need to know.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-js">let customer = {name: "person", address: "here"}
console.log(customer.toString())
//output: "[object Object]"

customer.__proto__.toString = ()=&gt;{alert("polluted")}
console.log(customer.toString())
// alert box pops up: "polluted"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Besides this I did my first KOTH on THM, which was quite fun, but I was destroid by a kid halv my age :) Yes this shows me again how much I still need to learn.
</p>

<p>
But as THM not even shows an prototype pollution rooms, I understand that this integrity challanges are defenitly out of my league, but maybe thats the thin I need?
