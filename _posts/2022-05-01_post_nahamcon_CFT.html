So what a weekend, Tears sweat and a lot of Brainpower&#x2026; the few houres I had to spend where amazing. Really Fun, asn definitly a challange, or some.
</p>

<p>
I learnt a ton of new stuff, and especially all the CFT related, things which where new to me&#x2026;. I expected a lot more of Web hacking, and a little less of all the other stuff.
</p>

<p>
Generally this are my results:
</p>

Robiks
<b>709th place</b> (Not that bad for a One-Man show and ~3200 Teams
<b>918 points</b>
</p>

I still have to process the huge amounts of mistakes I made, and issues I had. Mostly with not really trusting my selve.
E.g. in the Gossip challange where I messed up the ssh key, and instead of focusing on that I tried everthing else. Which was obviously false.
Also with the Keeber challenge&#x2026; I was thinking on the Wayback Url's But I was never looking at the Internet Archive&#x2026; I need to stick to my ideas.. they are mostly not that wrong.
</p>

<p>
If I had more time I would also write a Write-up&#x2026; but thats not possible at the moment.
But really I enjoyed it a lot. But the Reverse Engigneering Challange really bothers me a lot.
</p>

<p>
And I have some new topics to look at:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Binary Exploitation</li>
<li>Android Hacking</li>
</ul>
