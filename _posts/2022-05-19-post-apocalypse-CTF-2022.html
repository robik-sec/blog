Place 574 from 3697, is definitly not that bad, especially for a one-man-show.

It at least in the top 20%, which is already amazing for me, keeping in mind that I'm not learning since 3 Month.

But what I find the funniest, I reaally was quite good in reversing, and had no real chance on the web category. Although, I'm again my biggest enemy.
I spend to much time about saying that this won't be the right way, instead of trying. And honestly I expected the beginner challanges to be much easier. So I thought I'm thinking too complex.
And on the otherhand, I've seen that my ideas where often correct, but I did not execute them correctly. So keep in mind, most of the time my ideas are correct, so keep trying, and do not give up that
easy.
